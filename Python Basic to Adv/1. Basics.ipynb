    "#### A namespace is a system that has a unique name for each and every object in Python. \n",
    "#### An object might be a variable or a method. \n",
    "#### Python itself maintains a namespace in the form of a Python dictionary.\n",
    "#### Let’s go through an example, a directory-file system structure in computers. \n",
    "#### Needless to say, that one can have multiple directories having a file with the same name inside every directory. \n",
    "#### But one can get directed to the file, one wishes, just by specifying the absolute path to the file.\n",
    "#### Real-time example, the role of a namespace is like a surname. One might not find a single “Alice” in the class there might be multiple “Alice” but when you particularly ask for “Alice Lee” or “Alice Clark” (with a surname), there will be only one (time being don’t think of both first name and surname are same for multiple students).\n",
    "#### On similar lines, the Python interpreter understands what exact method or variable one is trying to point to in the code, depending upon the namespace. \n",
    "#### So, the division of the word itself gives a little more information. \n",
    "#### Its Name (which means name, a unique identifier) + Space(which talks something related to scope).\n",
